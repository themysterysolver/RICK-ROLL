## RICK-ROLLðŸ•º

The Rickroll meme originated from an internet bait-and-switch prank involving the 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley. ðŸ•º
The prank works by misleading someone into clicking a disguised link that unexpectedly redirects them to the song's music video.ðŸª©

## DIRECTORY

- VARIANT-1:
  - **PATH:**  `RICK-ROLL\LEARNING\TRY\rick-it.c`
  - This is done with the help of extraction of images,then converting them into txt.I used `ffmpeg` and `jp2a`.And this video to achieve the goal.
  - This has a *10fps* and aspect ratio of *8-:40*
  - We can use this in `RICK-ROLL\LEARNING\TRY\script.sh`
    
    ```
     --chars=" ."
    #this removes the letters and we can just get `.` and spaces
    ```
- VARIANT-2:
  - **curl:**curl (Client URL) is a cmd tool used to transfer data from or to a server using various protocols. `curl ascii.live/rick`
- VARIANT-3:
  - The `new_rick.c` file in first `RICK_ROLL` *directory* does rick roll by getting image from `curl` tool then converting them into frames and display them!
  - The `rick_roll.c` get's the same from `curl` but does not convert into frame.
